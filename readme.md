## Usage

Once you have installed the firmware on your ESP32, you can start using your vintage phone as a voice assistant. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Power On**: Connect your ESP32 to a power source.
2. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Ensure your ESP32 is connected to your home Wi-Fi network.
3. **Voice Commands**: Use the rotary dial to initiate voice commands. The system will respond accordingly.

## Customization

You can customize your **Fetap-32** experience by editing the YAML configuration file. Here are some ways to personalize your setup:

### Adding New Commands

1. Open the `config.yaml` file in your favorite text editor.
2. Add new voice commands under the `voice` section.
3. Save your changes and upload the configuration to your ESP32.

### Adjusting Dial Sensitivity

If you find that the rotary dial is too sensitive or not sensitive enough, you can adjust the settings in the `config.yaml` file. Look for the `dial` section and modify the parameters as needed.

### Creating Automations

You can set up automations to trigger actions based on specific commands. For example, you can program your phone to turn on the lights when you say "turn on the lights."
